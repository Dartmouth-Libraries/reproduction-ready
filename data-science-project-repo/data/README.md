# Data

During the project lifecycle, several versions of your data will be created. All of them should be kept in this folder, but in separate subdirectories to keep things organized.

If your dataset is large, this folder should be just a placeholder and its files are not committed to the repository. In that case, there should be script in `../scripts` that manages downloading or mounting the files here.
