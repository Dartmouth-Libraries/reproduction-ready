# Reproduction-ready - A proper project setup for Python and beyond

A session on good practice surrounding managing your computational project.

## Session description

Computational research projects involve a lot of moving parts: data, code, visualizations, manuscript draftsâ€¦ How do you keep all of this organized?

This workshop will discuss everything that you need to streamline your project organization. We will look at tools and techniques that will help you stay on top of your projects without adding too much additional work. The main focus will be on Visual Studio Code and Python-related best practices, but there will be helpful information for you even if you use neither of these tools.

This session is perfect for learners who have some experience with computational projects and programming in Python, but no prior knowledge of either is required.
